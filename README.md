## Author Notes

I've heard from a few people struggling with tsfresh and featuretools for chapter 3.

[My PR](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/912) for tsfresh was merged mid-December fixing a version incompatibility - featuretools went through many breaking changes with the release of version 1.0.0 (congratulations to the team!). Please see how to fix any problems in the [discussion here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-for-Time-Series-with-Python/issues/2).
